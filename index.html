                            it was flat. They built an observatory to look at the stars.

                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb built in the 17th century by king Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz 
                    Mahal. Its chief architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Widely thought as one of the most 
                    beautiful buildings in the world, it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, together 
                    with the Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away. It was listed as one of the 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is located on the south bank of Yamuna river in Agra. It is a splendid monument, but because of pollution, the Taj Mahal is turning yellow. 
                    It Is one of the most notable examples of Islamic architecture built. When the Taj Mahal was built most of India was ruled over by the Mughal 
                    empire which ruled over all of India except for the South. Shah Jahan was a Mughal emperor who came in to power around 1628.

                        <h2>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a building in Pisa, Italy. It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. 
                            In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it 
                            from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of 
                            scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again. The height of the tower is about 56 metres from 
                            the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees.

                            The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished 
                            in 1878[1] and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure 
                            humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) chinky and 15 metres high. The earlier 
                            sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch 
                            towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals.
