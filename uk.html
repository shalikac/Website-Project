            <h2>The British Museum</h2>
            <p>
                The British Museum is a public museum dedicated to human history, art and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London. 
                Its permanent collection of eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence. 
                It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. The British Museum was the first public national museum 
                in the world. The Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir 
                Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. The museum's expansion 
                over the following 250 years was largely a result of British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch 
                institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881. In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 
                detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same 
                Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997. Wikipedia

            <h2>Tower of London</h2>
            <p>
                The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle on the north 
                bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern 
                edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part 
                of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was 
                a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 until 
                1952, although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the 
                Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of 
                expansion, mainly under kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the 
                late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site. The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history.

                <h2>Buckingham Palace</h2>
                <p>
                    Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. Located in the City 
                    of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British 
                    people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace 
                    was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. 
                    It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. During 
                    the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, who constructed three wings around a central 
                    courtyard. Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.

            <h2>Natural History Museum</h2>
            <p>
                The Natural History Museum in London is a museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. 
                It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and 
                Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road. The museum is home to life and earth science 
                specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. 
                The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of 
                the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly 
                famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—both exemplified by the large 
                Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the 
                ceiling. Wikipedia

            <h2>St. Paul's Cathedral</h2>
            <p>
                St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London and is the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother 
                church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. 
                Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating 
                from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's 
                lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral, largely 
                destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard,
                 being the site of St Paul's Cross. The cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by 
                 the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 feet high, it was the tallest building in 
                 London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. Wikipedia

                <h2>Tower Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace 
                    Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London 
                    and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust founded in 1282. The bridge was 
                    constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century. The bridge 
                    was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894. The bridge is 800 feet in length and consists of two 
                    213-foot bridge towers connected at the upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow 
                    shipping. Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972. The bridge is 
                    part of the A100 London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic route 
                    with 40,000 crossings every day. Wikipedia
