                <h2>The British Museum</h2>
                <p>
                    The British Museum is a public museum dedicated to human history, art and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London. 
                    Its permanent collection of eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence. 
                    It documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present. The British Museum was the first public national museum 
                    in the world. The Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir 
                    Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building.

                <h2>Tower of London</h2>
                <p>
                    The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle on the north 
                    bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is separated from the eastern 
                    edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part 
                    of the Norman Conquest. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was 
                    a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was also used as a prison from 1100 until 
                    1952, although that was not its primary purpose.

                <h2>Buckingham Palace</h2>
                <p>
                    Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the monarchy of the United Kingdom. Located in the City 
                    of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British 
                    people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. Originally known as Buckingham House, the building at the core of today's palace 
                    was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. 
                    It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as The Queen's House. Buckingham 
                    Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837.

                <h2>Natural History Museum</h2>
                <p>
                    The Natural History Museum in London is a museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. 
                    It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and 
                    Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road. The museum is home to life and earth science 
                    specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. 
                    Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected 
                    by Charles Darwin.

                <h2>St. Paul's Cathedral</h2>
                <p>
                    St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London and is the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother 
                    church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. 
                    Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating 
                    from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's 
                    lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London.The dome is still one of the highest in 
                    the world.

                <h2>Tower Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894, designed by Horace 
                    Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London 
                    and is one of five London bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust founded in 1282. The bridge was 
                    constructed to give better access to the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century.The bridge 
                    is part of the A100 London Inner Ring Road and thus the boundary of the London congestion charge zone, and remains an important traffic 
                    route with 40,000 crossings every day.
